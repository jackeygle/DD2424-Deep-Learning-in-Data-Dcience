- **Input:** Sequence of characters
- **Output:** Next character prediction
- **Sequence Length:** Variable (typically 25-100 characters)

## 🧠 Network Architecture

### Vanilla RNN Implementation
```
Input: x_t (one-hot encoded character)
Hidden: h_t = tanh(W_hh * h_{t-1} + W_xh * x_t + b_h)

```

### LSTM Implementation (Bonus)
```
Forget Gate: f_t = σ(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
Input Gate: i_t = σ(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
Candidate: C̃_t = tanh(W_C * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
Cell State: C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t
Output Gate: o_t = σ(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)

```

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Vanilla RNN Forward Pass
```python
def rnn_forward(X, h_prev, Wxh, Whh, bh):
    """
    Forward pass for vanilla RNN
    X: input sequence (seq_len, vocab_size)
    h_prev: previous hidden state
    """
    h = {}
    h[-1] = np.copy(h_prev)
    
    for t in range(len(X)):
        h[t] = np.tanh(Wxh @ X[t] + Whh @ h[t-1] + bh)
    
    return h
```

### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
```python
def rnn_backward(X, Y, h, Wyh, by):
    """
    Backward pass with BPTT
    Compute gradients for all time steps
    """
    dWxh = np.zeros_like(Wxh)
    dWhh = np.zeros_like(Whh)
    dbh = np.zeros_like(bh)
    dh_next = np.zeros_like(h[0])
    
    for t in reversed(range(len(X))):
        # Output layer gradients
        dy = np.copy(Y[t])
        dy[targets[t]] -= 1
        
        # Hidden layer gradients
        dh = Wyh.T @ dy + dh_next
        dh_raw = (1 - h[t] * h[t]) * dh  # tanh derivative
        
        # Parameter gradients
        dWxh += dh_raw @ X[t].T
        dWhh += dh_raw @ h[t-1].T
        dbh += dh_raw
        
        dh_next = Whh.T @ dh_raw
    
    return dWxh, dWhh, dbh
```

### Text Generation
```python
def generate_text(seed_char, length, temperature=1.0):
    """
    Generate text using trained RNN
    """
    x = char_to_ix[seed_char]
    h = np.zeros((hidden_size, 1))
    generated = []
    
    for t in range(length):
        h = np.tanh(Wxh @ x + Whh @ h + bh)
        y = Wyh @ h + by
        
        # Apply temperature for sampling diversity
        p = np.exp(y / temperature) / np.sum(np.exp(y / temperature))
        ix = np.random.choice(range(vocab_size), p=p.ravel())
        
        x = np.zeros((vocab_size, 1))
        x[ix] = 1
        generated.append(ix_to_char[ix])
    
    return ''.join(generated)
```
